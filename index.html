            <h3>Being Appointed</h3>
            <p>
                On May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals
                for the Seventh Circuit — the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin — 
                after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.
                Barrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017,
                 almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation. Her appointment was surrounded by controversy as she was elected 
                 near the end of Donald Trump's term
